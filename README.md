Weather API:

A third-party API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) is used to fetch real-time weather data based on the city name input by the user.
Font Awesome:

Used for including icons that represent different weather conditions.
Images/SVGs:



Utilized for dynamic backgrounds that change based on the current weather conditions.
